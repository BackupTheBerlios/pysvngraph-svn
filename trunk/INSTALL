A. OS specific

    Windows users :
    ---------------

    Install the win32 NSIS installer. It will associate pysvngraph to .pysvngraph files
    Just click on a .pysvngraph file

    Every other users :
    -------------------

    Use python source, and execute pysvngraph.py with a .pysvngraph file as argument.

B. Configuration files

    The configuration system is very simple, but may seems strange at first glance.
    A configuration setting is a set of cuples (key,value) that provide information
    to pysvngraph.

    A configuration file has a .ini structure (More exactly, it's read by a Python's ConfigParser)

    The special section "[main]" is the main section of the file. It's this one that is read.

    this section may include several other sections by using the special "sections" key, containing
    a list separated by "," of the sections to include. So it's easy to make several set of
    configurations and include them or not.

    You can even use sections from other files. Just put a "files" key with names of
    the files (without the .pysvngraph extension) separated by ",". The sections will be search in all the files
    specified by the "files" special key.

    You can of course use files from several directories. Just put a "dirs" ky with names of the
    directories separated by ",". The files in the "files" key will be searched in all the
    directories listed in "dirs" special key.

    Exemple :
        [main]
        dirs=/usr/share/pysvngraph/config
        files=style,default
        sections=pdf,graph-simple

C. Dependences

    pysvngraph use python.
    * It works on python2.2 and python2.4 (it should work on python2.3)
    * pdf rendering require reportlab ( http://reportlab.org )
    * pysvn (svn extension for python), but hasn't been tested for times, and may not work anymore.
      Please use "file" instead. To create the history file, just use :

      $ svn log -v URL_OF_THE_ROOT_OF_YOU_REPOSITORY > FILENAME_YOU_WILL_USE_IN_THE_KEY_filename_OF_CONFIG

    Right now, only pdf and html can be generate. It would be quite simple to make some more backend.
